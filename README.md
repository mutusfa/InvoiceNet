# InvoiceNet
Classification of entities extracted from invoice scans

## Instructions
Two models have been implemented for the purpose of invoice data classification.

The first one is a convolution neural network which trains on custom word embeddings trained using word2vec.
```
python3 main.py -h
```

The second model is based on CloudScan.
```
python3 cloud_scan.py -h
```
